#MtGOX API v2 Node Client

This is node.js implementation for using Mt.GOX's HTTP API v2.
To use it, you must have already created an API Key on their [website](https://mtgox.com/security).

#Credit where it's due

nitrous - for the excellent API v2 [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/nitrous/mtgox-api/) that made this possible. Check out the docs to better understand the method parameters and resulting data objects.

[scud43](https://github.com/scud43) - for the work on the node-campbx repo, which this is borrowing very heavily from.

anonymous wiki updater - for creating the Mt.Gox HTTP API [v1 node.js client](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Node.js_Example) on the bitcoin wiki, which this client is entirely based on.  Let's face it, people that update wikis are just better people than you and I, and deserve some credit.  



Stay tuned for more stuff...
